      <h2>Why I want to join this program?</h2>
      <p>
        I reached a good level in Front-End Development, and have learned alot
        of skills like : Write Semantic HTML ,TailwindCSS, Vanilla JavaScript,
        React.JS ...etc. I can use these technologies to build front web apps
        but I do not have enough knowledge how the work in companies look like ,
        how can I communicate effectively with clients , how can I work with
        team , what are the other skills should I work on to be ready for build
        real projects with real clients . And I am sure this is the most
        suitable program to achieve my goal .
